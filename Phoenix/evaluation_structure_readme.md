# Adding Structure to Agent Responses

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Adding_structure.ipynb`) that focuses on structuring the output of AI agents to make their message responses more informative, consistent, and traceable. The notebook demonstrates how to process agent outputs, track their actions, and organize the message flow for better interpretability.

## Features

### ✅ 1. Message Formatting and Cleanup
- Normalizes agent responses by cleaning up raw text into structured formats.
- Assigns roles (e.g., user, assistant) to maintain a chronological conversational flow.
- Supports readability improvements for logs, reports, or visual tools.

### 🔁 2. Agent Execution Path Tracking
- Captures every message exchanged in the agent loop, recording each decision step.
- Computes message path length to quantify the complexity of agent behavior.
- Stores all message states to analyze transitions between thought steps.

### 🧠 3. Modular Agent Runner (`run_agent_and_track_path`)
- Accepts an example task and automatically invokes the defined agent.
- Returns a dictionary containing:
  - Message history
  - Length of interaction path
  - Optionally formatted message steps (for display or export)
- Can be extended to support timing analysis or token tracking.

### ⚖️ 4. Agent Swapping for Comparison
- You can plug in **different agent functions** (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4, or OpenAI vs Local LLM) to compare:
  - Total messages used
  - Quality and depth of responses
  - Logical flow in step-by-step outputs
- Helps in benchmarking or model evaluation tasks for AI agent research.

### 📊 5. Structured Output for Debugging and Evaluation
- Outputs messages in a dictionary format suitable for JSON export or further evaluation.
- Can be used to power front-end visualizations of thought processes (like graphs).
- Supports future additions like SHAP-like explanations or chain-of-thought breakdowns.

### 🛠️ 6. Easy Integration for Other Use Cases
- Add your own message wrapper, tool-use hooks, or intermediate evaluation checks.
- Fit this structure into:
  - Chatbot development
  - Autonomous agents
  - AI tutor systems
- Example customization: insert reward functions or scoring metrics inside the agent loop.

### 🔍 7. Debugging Made Easy
- If something fails in the message sequence, you get a complete trace of what happened.
- Each cell is modular, so you can pause at any step, examine internal state, and continue.

### 📁 8. Minimal Dependencies
- Built using standard libraries like `pandas` and `openai` with minimal setup.
- No external agent frameworks required—makes it easier to prototype and test.

### 🧪 9. Evaluation-Driven Agent Development

This project supports **Evaluation-Driven Development (EDD)** — a structured approach to iteratively improve LLM agents based on experimental feedback.

Key components:

#### 🧬 a. Curated Dataset of Test Cases
- Start with a small but **diverse** set of examples representing different types of user inputs.
- Include expected outputs where possible to unlock deeper evaluations.
- Test cases can come from:
  - Live agent runs
  - Manually constructed examples
  - Synthetic generation using another model

#### 🔧 b. Structured Experiments
- Modify different parts of your agent such as:
  - Prompt design
  - Tool descriptions
  - Routing logic
  - Skill modules or overall agent structure
  - Underlying LLM models
- Each combination of changes forms an **experiment variant** of the agent.

#### 📈 c. Automated Evaluation of Experiments
- Run your curated test set through each agent variant.
- Use code-based evaluators when ground truth outputs are known.
- Use **LLM-as-a-judge** when you want to assess quality heuristically without strict ground truth.

#### 🧩 d. Component-Level Evaluation
- Evaluate fine-grained outputs, such as:
  - SQL queries in a database tool before execution
  - Final answers vs intermediate reasoning steps
- Apply evaluators to each part of the agent pipeline to gain a holistic performance profile.

#### 🔁 e. Feedback Loop from Production
- Add new test cases and evaluations based on real-world agent usage.
- Create a **flywheel** where production informs development and vice versa.
- Continuously refine test coverage and agent reliability based on user data.
