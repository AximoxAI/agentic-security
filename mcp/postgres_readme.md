# Supercharging Postgres with AI Agents, MCP, and Arize Phoenix


As AI agents become increasingly prevalent in enterprise applications, the critical challenge shifts from building functional prototypes to creating reliable, observable, and trustworthy systems that can handle real-world data complexity. 
This talk demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow for building AI agents that can interact with PostgreSQL databases while maintaining full observability and evaluation capabilities.

We'll showcase a live demonstration using Model Context Protocol (MCP) to bridge the gap between LLMs and Postgres. Rather than relying on simplified examples, we'll work with complex, realistic database schemas and challenging queries that mirror what developers encounter in production environments.

The demonstration begins with establishing a connection between our AI agent and PostgreSQL through MCP, showcasing how this protocol enables seamless database interactions while maintaining security and performance standards. We'll then present the agent with increasingly sophisticated analytical tasks, including multi-table joins, aggregate functions, time-series analysis, and nested subqueries that would challenge even experienced SQL developers. We will also try out few operational Queries. 

What makes this presentation unique is our focus on observability and evaluation. Attendees will see how AI agents can interpret business questions like "What are the top-performing product categories by revenue growth in the last quarter, broken down by geographic region?" and translate them into complex SQL operations. We'll demonstrate multiple query variations to test the agent's consistency and accuracy across different phrasings of similar requests.

However, impressive demonstrations alone don't solve production challenges. The critical question becomes: how do we know when our AI agent gets it right, and more importantly, how do we catch it when it gets it wrong? This is where we leverage Arize Phoenix.

Using Arize Phoenix, we'll implement full instrumentation of our AI agent's decision-making process. Attendees will see real-time tracing of how queries are constructed, executed, and results are interpreted. We'll demonstrate Phoenix's hallucination detection capabilities, showing how the system identifies when an agent generates plausible-sounding but factually incorrect responses about database contents.

The evaluation component showcases both automated and human-in-the-loop assessment strategies. We'll present metrics for query accuracy, response relevance, and data fidelity. Attendees will see how to set up automated evaluation pipelines that can continuously assess agent performance across diverse query types and data scenarios.

The session concludes with actionable insights for implementing similar systems in production environments. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of how to integrate MCP with their existing PostgreSQL infrastructure, implement comprehensive monitoring with Arize Phoenix, and establish evaluation frameworks that ensure their AI agents remain reliable as they scale.
