Google’s A2A protocol offers a robust foundation for secure agent communication but
requires enhancements to handle sensitive data effectively. As evidenced in “AI Agents
Under Threat” [18], “AI Agents Meet Blockchain” [31], “Multi-Agent Security Tax”
[39], and “AgNet” [23], security and privacy challenges in multi-agent systems demand
12
solutions balancing robust protection with efficiency. This proposal introduces seven
enhancements: short-lived tokens, SCA, granular scopes, explicit consent, direct data
transfer, multitransaction approval, and payment standard compliance to improve security, privacy, and trust. 
The vacation booking example illustrates how these enhancements reduce risks and enhance user experience. We recommend Google implement this
proposal to strengthen A2A’s position as a leading standard for agent communication.

As autonomous agents powered by large language models proliferate across domains, the demand for secure, modular, and interoperable communication grows increasingly urgent.
This survey presented a structured analysis of four emerging protocols—MCP, ACP, A2A, and ANP—that each address distinct layers of agent interoperability. 
By unifying tool invocation, multimodal messaging, task coordination, and decentralized discovery, these protocols collectively form the foundation for scalable multi-agent systems. 
The comparative evaluation demonstrates that no single protocol suffices across all contexts; instead, a phased, complementary adoption strategy—beginning with MCP and progressing through ACP and A2A to ANP—offers a practical pathway for deploying agent ecosystems. 
Future research should explore protocol interoperability bridges, trust frameworks for agent collaboration, and standardized evaluation benchmarks to accelerate adoption and ensure resilience in real-world deployments. 
These foundational efforts will be critical for advancing the next generation of intelligent, networked agents.

ACP: a domain and agent-agnostic set of structured protocols for agent-agent communication, coordination, and error handling.
ACPs leverage persistent execution blueprints—structured dependency
graphs that encode task dependencies and store agent outputs—along with
standardized communication schemas, enabling robust and fault-tolerant
multi-agent collective inference. Our ACP-powered generalist multi-agent
systems achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results: 28.3% accuracy on AssistantBench for long-horizon web assistance and best-in-class multimodal
technical reports, outperforming commercial AI systems as evaluated by
humans. ACPs are highly modular and extensible, and enables practitioners to rapidly develop best-in-class generalist systems.
